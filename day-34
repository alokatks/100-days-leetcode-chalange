Largest Triangle Area:
Apporach is : we will pick three points to find area by using three nested loop and than  get x1 and x2 x3 y1 y2 y3 and than you can apply eather herones forumla or Shoelace's Formula (also known as Gauss's area formula and surveyor's formula):
and you have to  maintain one maxarea variable also 

  CODE:
class Solution {
    public double largestTriangleArea(int[][] points) {
        double maxArea=0;
        int n= points.length;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                for(int k=j+1;k<n;k++){
                    int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
                    int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
                    int x3 = points[k][0], y3 = points[k][1];
                    double area=0.5*Math.abs(x1*(y2 - y3) + x2*(y3 - y1) + x3*(y1 - y2));
                    maxArea=Math.max(maxArea,area);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
